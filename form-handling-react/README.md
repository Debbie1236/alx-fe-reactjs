Objective: Learn to manage form data in React using controlled components and then transition to using Formik for more complex form handling, focusing on a practical application involving a specific API.

Task Description:
This task will guide you through building and managing a user registration form in React. First, using controlled components to handle form states manually, and then leveraging Formik for advanced form handling capabilities. You will work with a mock API endpoint to simulate user registration.

Step 1: Set Up the React Project
Project Setup:

Create a new React project:

npm create vite@latest form-handling-react -- --template react
cd form-handling-react
Step 2: Create a User Registration Form Using Controlled Components
Build a Controlled Form:
Develop a RegistrationForm component under src/components folder that includes fields for username, email, and password.
Manage form states using React’s useState to handle values for each input field.
Add basic validation logic to check that no fields are left empty before submission.
Step 3: Transition to Formik for Form Handling
Integrate Formik:

Install Formik:

npm install formik
Refactor the RegistrationForm to use Formik, taking advantage of Formik’s built-in state management and validation capabilities. The new component should be named formikForm.js
Implement the same form using Formik’s Form, Field, and ErrorMessage components, including validation with Formik’s Yup.
